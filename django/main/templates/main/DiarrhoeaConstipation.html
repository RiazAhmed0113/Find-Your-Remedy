            <b>Diarrhoea</b> is common in adults, children and babies. It is often caused by a stomach bug and
            should stop in a few days.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Constipation</b> is where you have changes to how you poo, including not pooing as often or finding it hard to poo.
            It's common, and it affects people of all ages. You can usually treat it with simple changes to your diet and lifestyle.
            This page is about constipation in adults. There's separate information on constipation in babies and children.
